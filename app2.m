%% Bayes - A : Classification Algorithm (wih hypothesis of Gauss laws only)

%% Bayes - B : Classification Algorithm (without Gauss laws hypothesis, without mathematical expression of frontiers, with Bayes Risk)

%% Bayes - C : Classification Algorithm (with mathematical expression of frontiers, with hypothesis of Gauss Density Probability)
